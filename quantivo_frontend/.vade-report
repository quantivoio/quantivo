# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics in the Quantivo frontend application following the official Next.js App Router integration guide.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package (version ^1.6.1) to project dependencies
- Updated package-lock.json with the new dependency and its transitive dependencies

### 2. Modified Files
- **app/layout.js**: 
  - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component at the end of the body section, right after the `{children}` render
  - This placement ensures analytics tracking is initialized on all pages while keeping it outside the main content flow

### 3. Implementation Details
- Using Next.js App Router pattern (the project uses Next.js 16.1.6)
- The Analytics component is placed in the root layout, which means it will be included on every page
- The component placement follows Vercel's official documentation for Next.js App Router projects
- The Analytics component provides automatic route tracking for Next.js applications

### 4. Build Verification
- Successfully ran `npm run build` - build completed without errors
- The project compiles and generates all static pages correctly
- Existing linting errors in other files remain unchanged (not introduced by this change)

## Next Steps for the User
After deploying this code to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project > Analytics tab > Enable)
2. Deploy the application to Vercel
3. Once deployed, verify tracking by checking browser Network tab for requests to `/_vercel/insights/view`
4. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab

## Files Modified
- `quantivo_frontend/app/layout.js` - Added Analytics component import and render
- `quantivo_frontend/package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `quantivo_frontend/package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree

## Technical Notes
- The implementation follows the exact pattern specified in Vercel's documentation for Next.js App Router projects
- No breaking changes introduced
- The Analytics component is lightweight and won't impact page performance
- Analytics will only send data when deployed to Vercel (no data sent in local development by default)
